Hi, Here is some important things of my assignment2:

1. Every Host(server/client) is "127.0.0.1" and assigned as constant value.

2. The user parameter should insert as "{username}" and "chat://localhost:{PORT NUMBER}", where the localhost here is just a string not "127.0.0.1".

3. When to user Crtl-C to interrupt client chat, they may need to press ANY KEY to full exit, and I also mentions it on terminals.

4. I used the selectors package to registrate the client socket, and use argparse package to let user pass parameter, and use signal to detect the interrupt.

5. Hope my assignment wont be hard to assign it, and enjoy it :)

Thank you!
